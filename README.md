## An Attempt at Making a A.I bot in the style of AlphaGo but for Hnefatafl

Hnefatafl (Pronounced with a slient H) is a style of Tafl game from Northern Europe. 

There are two teams, Black (Attackers) and White (Defenders) where the goal is for the White player to escape with their King to a safe square on the corner squares. Black must attempt to stop the King from escaping by either directly capturing him or surrounding him so that he cannot escape.

This A.I will concentrate on first learning Copenhagen Hnefatafl 11Ã—11 first.
